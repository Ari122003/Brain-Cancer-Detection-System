<h1 align="center" id="title">Brain Cancer Detection System</h1>

<p id="description">This project is a brain cancer detection system developed using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The system has been trained on a dataset of over 3000 MRI brain images achieving an impressive accuracy of 99.54%. The project combines multiple technologies for the deep learning model and the web interface making it a robust and efficient solution for detecting brain cancer from MRI images.</p>
